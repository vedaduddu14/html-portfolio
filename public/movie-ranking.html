<h1>The Best Movies According to Veda</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice (2005)</h3>
<p>The 2005 version was beautifully potrayed capturing my most favourite elements of the book</p>
<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Doobara (2009)</h3>
<p>For a movie in 2009 it had some beautiful scenery and the movie gained more meaning with each character becoming a point of resonation at a different age</p>
<h3>Late Night (2019)</h3>
<p>A comedy film that somewhere makes you laugh, inspire and retrospect</p>
